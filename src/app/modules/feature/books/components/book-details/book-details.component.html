        The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence:
        at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed
        her in a languid, sleepy voice.There seemed to be no use in waiting by
        the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might
        find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting
        people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it.
